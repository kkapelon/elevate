About Project Elevate
============================================================================

Project Elevate is my personal experiment for a better User Interface 
that suits my needs without resorting to the WIMP desktop 
like GNOME or KDE. Since I use open source libraries to build it,
I also release it as open source, in case somebody else finds interesting
my ideas.

Using the Vault
============================================================================

The main idea behing the vault is a bold one. Instead of forcing the user
to manually organise the folder hierarchy in the home directory, let the computer
do this automatically.

Vault is a normal command line application.
Run it with the --help parameter to see all available options.
