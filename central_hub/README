About Project Elevate
============================================================================

Project Elevate is my personal experiment for a better User Interface 
that suits my needs without resorting to the WIMP desktop 
like GNOME or KDE. Since I use open source libraries to build it,
I also release it as open source, in case somebody else finds interesting
my ideas.
