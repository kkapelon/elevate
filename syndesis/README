About Project Elevate
============================================================================

Project Elevate is my personal experiment for a better User Interface 
that suits my needs without resorting to the WIMP desktop 
like GNOME or KDE. Since I use open source libraries to build it,
I also release it as open source, in case somebody else finds interesting
my ideas.

Syndesis 
============================================================================
Syndesis is just a collection of graphical utility applications.
They can be used standalone or via project elevate.

Apart from the usual stuff (gtk+,glib,cairo) you also need the curl headers to compile them. The package is named
libcurl3-dev in Debian Systems (possibly Ubuntu too).

The applications are

1)syndownload. A wrapper of curl. Takes a single argument (a URL). The application is non-interactive once it starts.

2)synview. A scrolling text viewer. Takes a single argument (file to open). In theory it should handle files of any size, since it reads them dynamically as the text scrolls.

Keyboard shotcuts:
Esc = Quit
Space = Stop/Resume scrolling


3)synnet. A network monitoring application for Linux. Takes no arguments.

Keyboard shortcuts:
Esc = Quit
Left = Previous Network Interface
Right = Next Network Interface
